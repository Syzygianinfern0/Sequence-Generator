Marshall, you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, god damn!\"\nUnfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown\nSo why don't you all sit down?\nListen to the tale I'm about to tell\nHell, we don't gotta trade our shoes\nAnd you ain't gotta walk no thousand milesIn my shoes, just to see\nWhat it's like, to be me\nI'll be you, let's trade shoes\nJust to see what it'd be like to\nFeel your pain, you feel mine\nGo inside each other's minds\nJust to see what we find\nLook at shit through each other's eyes\nBut don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh oh\nThey can all get fucked just stay true to you so oh oh\nSo don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh oh\nThey can all get fucked just stay true to you so oh ohNobody asked for life to deal us with these bullshit hands we're dealt\nWe have to take these cards ourselves and flip them, don't expect no help\nNow I could have either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned\nOr take this situation in which I'm placed in and get up and get my own\nI was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags\nWho sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did\nI just wanted to fit in at every single place every school i went\nI dreamed of being that cool kid even if it meant acting stupid\nAunt Edna always told me keep makin' that face it'll get stuck like that\nMeanwhile I'm just standin' there holdin' my tongue tryna talk like this\n'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at eight years old\nI learned my lesson then cause i wasn't tryna impress my friends no mo'\nBut I already told you my whole life story\nNot just based on my description\n'Cause where you see it from where you're sitting\nIs probably 110% different\nI guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes, at least\nWhat size you wear? I wear tens let's see if you can fit your feetIn my shoes, just to see\nWhat it's like, to be me\nI'll be you, let's trade shoes\nJust to see what it'd be like to\nFeel your pain, you feel mine\nGo inside each other's mind\nJust to see what we find\nLook at shit through each other's eyes\nBut don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh oh\nThey can all get fucked just stay true to you, so oh oh\nSo don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh oh\nThey can all get fucked just stay true to you, so oh ohLately I've been hard to reach\nI've been too long on my own\nEverybody has a private world where they can be alone\nAre you calling me?\nAre you trying to get through?\nAre you reaching out for me?\nI'm reaching out for you?Yeah\nTo my babies\nStay strong\nDaddy will be home soon\nAnd to the rest of the world\nGod gave you the shoes that fit you\nSo put 'em on and wear 'em\nAnd be yourself, man\nBe proud of who you are\nEven if it sounds corny\nDon't ever let no one tell you\nYou ain't beautiful"},

Think not\nWhy be a king when you can be a God?"},

My Name Is\" dropped\nStarted thinking my name was fault\nCause anytime things went wrong\nI was the one who they would blame it on\nThe media made me the, uh, equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan\nTried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg\nGangsta? Naw, courageous balls\nHad to change my style, they said I'm way too soft\nAnd I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws\nAnd the fangs been out since then\nBut up until the instant that I've went against it\nIt was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought\nNo wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught\nDo I really belong in this game? I pondered\nI just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?\nSo back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on\nAnd I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon\nBut sometimes you gotta take a loss\nAnd have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off\nAnd keep pluggin', it's your only outlet\nAnd your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it\nBetter find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah\nFeel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times\nHow many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?\nWhat I really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my story\nBet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are\nWhen I was afraid to...I was a...\nAfraid to make a single sound\nAfraid I would never find a way out, out, out\nAfraid I'd never be found\nI didn't wanna go another round\nAn angry man's power will shut you up\nTrip wires fill this house with tip-toe love\nRun out of excuses with every word\nSo here I am and I will not run\nGuts over fear, the time is here\nGuts over fear, I shall not tear\nFor all the times I let you push me around\nAnd let you keep me down\nNow I got, guts over fear, guts over fearFeels like a close, it's coming to\nFuck am I gonna do?\nIt's too late to start over\nThis is the only thing I, thing I knowIt's like I was there once, single parents\nHate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?\nAnd the pain spawns all the anger on\nBut it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on\nThat I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit\nLearned how to harness it while the reins were off\nAnd there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part\nWas soon as I stopped saying \"I gave a fuck\"\nHaters started to appreciate my art\nAnd it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I've caused\nBut what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?\nAnd the lights go out in that trailer park?\nAnd the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows\nAnd I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from\nJust a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun\nSo to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song\nBut I'd rather make \"Not Afraid 2\" than make another mothafuckin' \"We Made You\" uh\nNow I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs\nMy demise and my uprise, pray to God\nI just opened enough eyes later on\nAnd gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong\nEnough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt\nCause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt\nJust having to balance my dang self\nBut on eggshells I was made to walk\nBut thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the\nStrength to cause Shady-mania, so many empty that stadium\nAt least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done\nSo this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted\nI represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song\nAnd everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more\nFrom this day forward, just let them a-holes talk\nTake it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off\nThe legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone\nAnd to think I was... goneI was a...\nAfraid to make a single sound\nAfraid I would never find a way out, out, out\nAfraid I'd never be found\nI didn't wanna go another round\nAn angry man's power will shut you up\nTrip wires fill this house with tip-toe love\nRun out of excuses with every word\nSo here I am and I will not run\nGuts over fear, the time is here\nGuts over fear, I shall not tear\nFor all the times I let you push me around\nAnd let you keep me down\nNow I got, guts over fear, guts over fear"},
